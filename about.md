Hi there! I'm Harsh, and I am a Business Analytics student at <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Dallas</a>. 
An aspiring Data Scientist, I love to retrieve data and wrangle it to provide insights that can help anyone achieve their business outcomes ... 
something that's not otherwise possible without the skills behind the craft. My favorite areas of interest include Visualization and Story-Telling with Datasets and Statistics, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, AI, and all things data science.

Before coming to UT Dallas, I studied Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at the <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/" target="_blank">University of Pune</a> and worked 
at <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/" target="_blank">Markets and Markets</a> as an Analyst for Semiconductor Technology industry. 
During my short stint with the organization, I published 15+ business intelligence reports on high growth technology markets. 
You can find the links to reports in the publication section <a href="bit.ly/harshbg-ln" target="_blank">here</a>.

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading everything and anything, listening to podcasts, exploring new places, traveling, and capturing beautiful moments in my camera.
