<p>
I am currently a Business Analytics student at <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Dallas</a>. 
I consider myself an aspiring Data Scientist. I love to retrieve data, and wrangle it- and provide insights not otherwise possible without the skills behind the craft. 
My favorite areas of interest include- Visualizations and Story-Telling with Datasets and Statistics, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, AI, and all things data science. 
You can see what projects I am working on <a href="https://github.com/harshbg" target="_blank">here</a>.

Before coming to UT Dallas, I studied Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/" target="_blank">University of Pune</a> and worked 
for <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/" target="_blank">Markets and Markets</a> as an Analyst for Semiconductor Technology industry. 
During my stint I published 15+ business intelligence reports on high growth technology markets. 
You can find the links to reports in the publication section <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshbg/" target="_blank">here</a>.

At spare time, I enjoy reading everything and anything, listening podcasts, exploring new places, travel & photography.
