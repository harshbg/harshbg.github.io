My Impossible List

I have had traditional bucket lists for long time and I did't get around to much on the list. I figured much of the things would happen at sometime in the future and that did'nt implore me to take action now. 

To overcome the challange I have created my impossible list which is a combination of traditional bucket list and impossible list. 


The list is inspired by the idea from Joel Runyon, who created the [world’s first impossible list](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) and defined the [difference](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/) between it and a regular bucket list.


Put simply, the impossible list is an evolving rundown of encounters that expand upon one another, help other people just as yourself, and beseech you to make a move. 
This is mine, which is, obviously, ever-evolving.
