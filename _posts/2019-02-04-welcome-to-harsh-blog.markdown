First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Harsh Gupta`, an *aspiring Data Scientist* and a *Technology Enthusiast* from Dallas, TX who loves to solve complex problems help businesses succeed with their goals.

I was born in Sevagram, India and travelled to the United States for my masters program in Business Analytics from [The University of Texas at Dallas][utd] and will graduate in May 2019.

I have over 4 years professional experience in data analysis and management consulting.
 I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. I started programming in R and Python from the year 2017, since then I have come far and learnt a lot. I am constantly looking to work on exciting projects.

#### I believe in the statement -
> "The hard work puts you where the good luck can find you."


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my todo list. Finally today I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting problem solving, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.
